# BASIS-Coding
The Basis GitHub repository for making projects and sharing ideas in Python.
Rules:
  1) Be Respectful
    Treat everyone with kindness and respect.
    Avoid offensive language or behavior.
  2) How to Contribute
    Make Changes: Create your own copy of the project (fork it/rename your project beginning with your name/username, then the original project's name), then make your changes. 
    Branch Names: Name your branches in a way that describes what you're working on (e.g., calculator, rock-paper-scissor game).
  3) Documentation
    Add Comments: Explain complex parts of the code to help others understand it.
    Describe Your Changes: Write clear and easy-to-understand messages about what your changes do. You may include comments in your code, so other people can understand what you are doing.
  4) Repository Maintenance
    Archiving: If your own project is no longer active, consider archiving it.
  5) Security
    No Sensitive Info: Donâ€™t include private information like passwords or API keys.
    Report Issues: Let us know privately if you find any security problems.
  6) Have Fun
    Most importantly, have fun! Help each other out on your projects, and remember this is a hobby, not a competition.
